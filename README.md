# (01/22/22) v2.0
I spent all of winter break rewriting the entire frontend with TypeScript. Both the frontend and backend are in a good state so that future changes won't require large overhauls. Using TypeScript lets me better control the API requests because I can let it know what the schema will look like. It takes away the guesswork from making requests. I'm pretty happy with all the changes and it should make it easier to add the features that I want moving forward. Hope you enjoy!

## 📨 Changelog
- New homepage!
- More consistent and unique design language
- Added animations for content loads and dropdown click
- Removed side bar. Just a top nav now
